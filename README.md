# 👋 Hi, I’m Jessie

I work in **Technical Operations (Systems & Infrastructure Security)** —  
which means I keep systems stable, secure, and slightly less angry.

I spend most of my time:
- Thinking of **crazy ideas** that *actually* work  
- Automating repetitive processes (because life is too short for manual tasks)
- Breaking complex systems down until they finally **make sense**

If there’s a faster, cleaner, or smarter way to do something — I *will* try to find it.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- ⚙️ Process improvement & automation
- 🔐 Systems & infrastructure security
- 🧪 Testing, validation, and “what could go wrong?” thinking
- 🔍 Turning vague problems into clear, working solutions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Things I enjoy building with (and occasionally arguing with):

- **Frontend / App:** Streamlit, Flutter, React  
- **Cloud & Automation:** boto3 (AWS), scripts that save hours  
- **Other Skills:** debugging under pressure, asking *why*, fixing root causes

> I also have a few **private projects** because not everything should see daylight 👀

---

## 🚀 Current Interests
- Automation that replaces manual workflows
- Improving reliability before things hit production
- Making systems easier to understand for the *next* person (future me included)

---

## 💡 Fun Facts
- 🏋️ Goes to the gym (to offset sitting and debugging)
- 📚 Constantly learning new things — sometimes intentionally
- 🧩 Enjoys figuring things out *the hard way* first
- ☕ Debugging success rate increases after coffee
- 🧠 Believes “simple” is harder — and worth it
